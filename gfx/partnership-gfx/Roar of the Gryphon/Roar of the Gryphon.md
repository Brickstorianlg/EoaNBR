> Roar of the Gryphon's Folder
Roar of the Gryphon is a mod for HOI4, taking a deep dive into a 1920ies world where Friedrich III, second Emperor of Germany, exceeded his rather short lifespan and led the German Empire and Europe as a whole into a far different future. WW1 never took place, the Old Empires, such as the Ottomans, Austria Hungary and the Russians, are still around and the world seems to be peaceful, at least if someone were to ignore the instability and chaos within the realms of the former hegemons of Europe.
