 NATION_DIVIDED_NAME: "A Nation Divided"
 NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "The world is on thin ice once again; the Americans have been plunged into civil war, and Prussia threatens to destablize the balance in Europe after their crushing defeat in the Italian War. War is not eminent across Europe yet, but only god will tell how chaos will rupture the peace."
 CSA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "The Confederacy has arose. Different cultures, different views and different policies lead to the inevitable division. \n\nThe Confederate States now must decide, whether to stand their ground in the southern states, or reclaim the lands of the Union for their own. The strike of Fort Sumter will only be one of many..."
 USA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "For the last decade, the United States has gone through attempts towards liberty; the beginning of a Civil War shows how effortless it might have been. \n\nThe Union has a mission to reunite the Americans under one banner, the torch of freedom no matter how blood may be spilled... Otherwise the Americans could remain divided."
 FRA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "The French Empire is on the rise; under Napoleon III's rule the French has seen many victories in their current wars. However, France is not unchallenged within Europe, the rise of the Prussians threat the fragile balance restored decades ago, and Catholic supporters are outraged at the new Italian state. \n\n A new conflict is simmering."
 PRS_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "Ever since the March revolutions, the idea of a new Germany was clear and seemingly unevitable. Many states under the German Confederation urge for a new nation; the question is who shall lead it. \n\nFor long Prussia has seen the Austrians as their nemesis, and saw themselves as the heir to the Holy Roman Empire. The false peace within Europe is soon to be shattered."
 AUS_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "After adopting the February Patent not quite far ago, the Austrian Empire is in their prime. Some disputes within the Magyar question the Austrian authority, but the Hungarians are the least of the Austrian problems. \n\nThe newly rising Prussia challenges Austria in their long heritage of Germanic rule, and conflicts over the lands of Schleswig-Holstein rise. The German Question must be settled, one way or another."
 ITA_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "Italy is finally on the verge to unification, after the victory of the Second War of Independence against Austria and the successful Mille expedition. Victor Emmanuel is now the leader of the new Italian Kingdom, proclaimed less than a month ago. \n\nNow the Roman Question of Rome and Venice rises, and within the nation the French control of Savoy and Nice sows discontent. It is questionable if Rome will rise again, but when it does so blood will be spilled."
 OTO_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "Modernization is rapidly under process in Europe, and the Ottomans were chasing the westernizing process for the last century. It was quite evident that the Ottomans were in decline, despite their close victory in the Crimean Wars. Abdülmecit I is now old, and his rule could end any day. \n\nThe Ottomans are put upon a long road of tribulations, and the following decades will be decisive for their survival."
 ENG_NATION_DIVIDED_DESC: "The mid-Victorian Era has come in the land where the sun never sets. Russia has been beaten in the Crimean War and at home, peace and prosperity spreads across the empire. The crown of Great Britain seems unchallenged; but even now trouble stirs. England is surrounded by rising threats in both Europe and America. \n\nHow they react will forever change the destiny of the world."
 OTHER_EOANB_DESC: "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPax-Britannica, as it is said on the isles of Great Britain and its ever-expanding empire; a power incomparable and lacking hindrance, one without peer nor challenge as nobody dares face Her Majesty's Armada. Its victims suppose elsewise, coining the era instead as Imperium-Britannica, or British Eminence. The conflicts of recent have reshaped and plotted out who will have their influence where, and if contested against the victors, then be damned and included in their spheres of damnation.\nBut there are many nations of old lurking, ready to be explored and conquered, or lead to victory, across the ever-industrializing world . . ."
 BLOOD_AND_IRON_NAME: "Blood and Iron"
 BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "The forces of Nationalism are triumphant in Europe. The Kingdom of Piedmont and Prussia ousted the Habsburgs and their allies, with the Italian peninsula finally unified and Bismarck's Realpolitik confederating the Germans under Prussia's influence. As Pax Britannica continues, the British Empire and their influence expand in Africa and Asia. In the New World, Brazil and The United States reconstruct after asserting their dominance in the Americas. \nAs France and Prussia fight a decisive war, the future and stability of Europe is unpredictable and rests in the hands of those two powers."
 ENG_BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "By 1870 the United Kingdom was the most industrialised and the most powerful country in the world. It possessed the world's largest Empire, protected by a very formidable navy. Imperialism was popular and during this period Britain added to her colonial possessions.\n\nHowever, the Industrial revolution had created severe social problems, as Britain became the world's most urbanised country. Over half of her population lived in cities. The social problems were to be found especially in the area of housing, education and health care."
 JAP_BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "The collapse of Japan's Tokugawa shogunate and the restoration of direct imperial power marked the start of the Meiji Restoration. The shogunate's isolationist strategy was challenged in the nineteenth century by Russia, Britain, and the United States, making Japanese feudal elites aware of Japan's susceptibility to superior Western weaponry. Following Commodore Matthew Perry's visit, Japan was obliged to sign a series of unequal treaties that, like China, granted Western powers unique advantages in Japan. Young samurai from feudal lands that had been traditionally antagonistic to the Tokugawa system rose up against the government in retaliation. They declared the Emperor's return to power in January 1868, and the final Tokugawa soldiers surrendered in May 1869, after much intense battle. The revolutionaries have urged the Emperor to issue the Charter Oath, which promises a break between the feudal class restrictions of the past and a search for knowledge that could transform Japan into a modernized, thriving country, featuring a bolstering economy and a Western army. The restoration ushered in the Meiji period, a time of rapid modernization and Westernization."
 PRS_BLOOD_AND_IRON_DESC: "Having only recently been formed, the North German Confederation is considered by many as nothing more than Prussia's first step in German unification. With Austrian interference now no longer a threat following the Brothers War of 1866 and the German Confederation fully dissolved, Prussia has shown now that its dominance over the European continent may soon be undisputed. The federations future prospects seem to only be positive, even now as France continues to show abject disapproval of its rise in power and influence. Ever so close to unification, the stage is now set for the North German Confederation to make its most critical and decisive move yet; the leaders of the world are now watching the stage with keen interest, and spiraling fear."


 NOON_OF_EMPIRES_NAME: "Noon of Empires"
 NOON_OF_EMPIRES_DESC: "The rebirth of European power and pre-eminence on the world stage has reawakened the imperialist ambitions of a bygone age. As Europeans begin to contest one another over new colonial ventures destined to spread far and wide over the vast continents of Africa and Asia, the United States continues its aggressive expansion across North America fueled by a rapidly expanding economy, as Latin America reaffirms their independence. Fantastic new technologies from inventors like Thomas Edison enlighten the globe like never before. In the East, new movements within China and Japan call for modernization and resistance, but it may be too late..."

 MODERN_DAY_NAME: "Modern Day"
 MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With the technological advances one the rise, there is a few problems that a rising, with COVID-19 breaking out in December of 2019, and the Russo-Ukrainian war breaking out in February of 2022, the economies of many major powers have began to go into a spiral mess. In China, there is a yuan crisis, in the U.S., there is a spike in gas and consumer prices, and in Europe, there is a spike in refugee housing costs because of the Ukrainian people fleeing westwards."
