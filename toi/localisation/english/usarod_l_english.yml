 acw_reconstruction.2.d: "The American Civil War has concluded, but the culture and living of the people of [FROM.GetName] still has drastic differences from our own.

 acw_reconstruction.6.desc: "In the city of Pulaski, Tennessee, a group of six former Confederate officers, Frank McCord, Richard Reed, John Lester, John Kennedy, J. Calvin Jones, and James Crowe, founded a group known as the "Ku Klux Klan." The KKK was a fraternal organization inspired by the "Sons of Malta." Throughout Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan perpetrated numerous atrocities against free black Americans, U.S. forces, and even elected officials. They did everything from thievery to murder to taking over government offices.\n\nAs the Federal government, it will be your job to deal with these terrorists, one way or another."
