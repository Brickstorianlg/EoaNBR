 eoanb_bulgaria.10.t: "\"Girdap\""
 eoanb_bulgaria.10.d: "Girdap's constituent assembly was held on 1 December 1881, less than four years after the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule and the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria. Ruse prospered due to its role as a major port on the Danube, its rapid industrial development and its well-established ties with Central Europe along that river. Banking, however, was a new concept, as most people employed the services of money lenders and entrusted their savings to people they knew personally. The founders of Girdap sought to \"liberate the population of money lenders\", in the words of later bank director Boncho Boev. Due to an overall lack of capital in the country, interest rates of loans given by Girdap were nonetheless high: 15-18% as compared to the over 20-30% interest rate of money lenders. The bank officially commenced operations on 1 January 1882. It took its name from the Girdap neighbourhood of Ruse where the constituent assembly was held."
