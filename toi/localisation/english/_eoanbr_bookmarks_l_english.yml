  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1857_NAME: "The End of a New Beginning"
  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1857_DESC: "Empires are at their might. The powers of Europe spread their influence wide and far from the plains of Africa to the mountains of Asia. The end of the Crimean War ensures decades of peace and dust begins to settle in the Americas. Everything seems seamless, and the spread of civilization has brought another Renaissance onto the world. Yet cracks are not unseen; the British colonies of India crumble, and only God forsees what this will mean for the colonial powers.\n\nThe end of a system written in centuries is nigh, an end that will bring a new beginning to the world as we know it."

The world changes, however; the final jewel of India begins to crack under pressure. Religious conflicts have inflated to the point of threatening the position of the undefeatable Empire, and when one colony topples the rest would follow. Now the most feared has happened, the rebels have captured Delhi, and established a base. Britain still has plenty of men to her disposal, but without caution this very mutiny could lead to a downfall of India."ty of men to her disposal, but without caution this very mutiny could lead to a downfall of India."

Cavour has proved his legitimacy with the alliance of the Crimean through skrew diplomacy, and elevated the Kingdom of Sardinia to the order of the world powers. Sardinia-Piedmont has come a long way; but still a long road remains. The heart of the Roman Empire is controlled by the Papacy, and Southern Italy by the Two Sicilies. How a new Italy will be sculpted is decided on how the three powers retain their balance in the peninsula, and defend themselves from the cowering powers of Europe. The Risorgimento seems a step's pace far, but is a mile's march away."

 AUS_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "The Austrian Empire has been the uncontested power of Central Europe for centuries. Their reign and influence spans over tens of nationalities and the remnants of the Habsburg house still resides within countless numbers of courts. Their power was challenged once with the rise of Napoleon, but with the Western threat quelled and Russia recently defeated in the Crimean War, no-one in Europe remains to challenge the Austrian's power on land. But all is not stable; the intricate balance settled decades ago has broken 9 years ago, and Prussia continues to threat Austria by expanding their power in German lands."
 PIE_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Preparations for a new Italy are complete. Cavour has proved his legitimacy with the alliance of the Crimean through skrew diplomacy, and elevated the Kingdom of Sardinia to the order of the world powers. Sardinia-Piedmont has come a long way; but still a long road remains. The heart of the Roman Empire is controlled by the Papacy, and Southern Italy by the Two Sicilies. How a new Italy will be sculpted is decided on how the three powers retain their balance in the peninsula, and defend themselves from the cowering powers of Europe. The Risorgimento seems a step's pace far, but is a mile's march away."
 QNG_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "History has never been so crushing to the Empire. During the Opium War the Westerners came with warships and cannons; and they are here again. The Qing have remained as the greatest power of the east for millennia, and in the span of decades their strength has not only been challenged, but proved futile against imperialism and colonialism. Not much has changed since the first war, and now the Chinese have to protect their sovereignty and the Holy Mandate to their lands. \nAn uneasy position remains for the Empire, as like many whom once were undefeatable but collapsed under change."
