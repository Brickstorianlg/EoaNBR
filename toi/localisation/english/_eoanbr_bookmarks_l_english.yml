  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1857_NAME: "The End of a New Beginning"
  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1857_DESC: "Empires are at their might. The powers of Europe spread their influence wide and far from the plains of Africa to the mountains of Asia. The end of the Crimean War ensures decades of peace and dust begins to settle in the Americas. Everything seems seamless, and the spread of civilization has brought another Renaissance onto the world. Yet cracks are not unseen; the British colonies of India crumble, and only God forsees what this will mean for the colonial powers.\n\nThe end of a system written in centuries is nigh, an end that will bring a new beginning to the world as we know it."
  EOANBR_SCENARIO_1857_OTHER: "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPax-Britannica, as it is said on the isles of Great Britain and its ever-expanding empire; a power incomparable and lacking hindrance, one without peer nor challenge as nobody dares face Her Majesty's Armada. Its victims suppose elsewise, coining the era instead as Imperium-Britannica, or British Eminence.\n\nAcross the world, changes have come only in swift motions. Behind the shades of the autonomous, yet fragmented states in Europe and South America, the cries of liberty and unification have echoed since the Revolutions of 1848.\n\nRecent conflicts have reshaped and plotted out the lines of influence; be damned those who have become ensnared in the ever-expanding spheres of damnation. But there are many ancient nations lurking across the ever-industrializing world, ready to be explored and conquered, or to be led to victory..."

However even within the German Confederation, the rivalry between Prussia and the Austrian Empire troubles the weakly confined states.

Once the Emperor took power, he started to reform the country, and with efficient diplomacy, he managed to ensure Brazilian hegemony on South America, and with economic and scientific innovations, Brazil is now on a golden age. But the countries in South America threaten the Empire. \nSlavery and Industrialization are problems that the emperors need to solve, it depends on the population whether Brazil will become a superpower or collapse."

Cavour has proved his legitimacy with the alliance of the Crimean through skrew diplomacy, and elevated the Kingdom of Sardinia to the order of the world powers. Sardinia-Piedmont has come a long way; but still a long road remains. The heart of the Roman Empire is controlled by the Papacy, and Southern Italy by the Two Sicilies. How a new Italy will be sculpted is decided on how the three powers retain their balance in the peninsula, and defend themselves from the cowering powers of Europe. The Risorgimento seems a step's pace far, but is a mile's march away."

With the arrival of his ominous "black ships", a decade of sociopolitical and economic strife has ravaged the islands. The people are divided over whether to trust these foreigners, or remove them by any means necessary. Whether the Japanese people will put their faith in the Shōgun or the Emperor to carry out this decision, only time will tell..."

For this to be possible, we must preserve governmental stability above all else and choose our political and financial movements very carefully.\n\nThe future is uncertain for the Kingdom of Spain, and with every opportunity comes a threat.
