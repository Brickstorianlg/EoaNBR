   QNG_infantry_equipment_pre_rifle_2_desc: "Prior to the introduction of the bayonet in the late 17th century, the pike and shot was a historical infantry tactical formation that initially arose during the Italian Wars of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Troops armed with pikes and soldiers equipped with arquebuses and/or muskets formed this sort of configuration. Other weapons, like as swords, halberds, and crossbows, were used on occasion."
