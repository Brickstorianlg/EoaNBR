    institution_industrialization: "Industrialization"
    institution_industrialization_desc: "Industrialization, or the Industrial Revolution, was a period from the late eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries in which a transition from hand production methods to machines occurred. As well as increased use of steam and water power, it also boosted the use of textiles, and the textile industry was the first to use modern production methods. The start of the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, as most of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin and design. The Industrial Revolution was also a major turning point in history, only compared to the adoption of agriculture."
    institution_mechanization: "Mechanization"
    institution_mechanization_desc: "Mechanization involves a mass transition from hand-production methods to machines. Once this is completed, the speed at which we can produce things will increase by a lot due to the automatic processes that these machines have. We can use things such as steam or water to help further the automatic process. Mechanization started with the Industrial Revolution, but just during this time, it was embraced heavily, with a majority of hand production methods now machines. Alongside this, the idea of heavy industrialization will spread amongst nations in order to keep up with the rest."
    institution_electrification: "Electrification"
    institution_electrification_desc: "We can start to convert a good amount of our power away from fossil fuels and into electricity from things such as water, steam, and wind. We can also use this in the industrial sector in order to use fewer fossil fuels and use more renewable energy sources in order to increase efficiency and decrease pollution. We can use this new electricity in lighting as well, with newer light bulbs and other things now being a thing."
    institution_mass_transit: "Mass Transit"
    institution_mass_transit_desc: "With better methods of transportation, such as better roads, buses, and integrated tram systems, we can now use the idea of mass transit across our nation. By using these, we can increase the way we transport things around, transport our people, and transport military equipment. This can allow for rapid military deployment when needed, and for our troops to receive better supplies due to new faster methods of travel."
    institution_telecommunications: "Telecommunications"
    institution_telecommunications_desc: "The method of communicating via wire, air, and optics, telecommunication, allowed the transfer of information to the horizons at speeds previously unimaginable. The ease of transmission of data, news, and the like allowed information to spread much more quickly through a populace, government, and command at greater efficacy, bringing upon many changes in how both people and nations viewed accessibility to what lay beyond home."
    institution_mass_production: "Mass Production"
    institution_mass_production_desc: "Mass production is the production of substantial quantities of standardized products in a constant flow, especially on assembly lines. Mass production techniques predate the Industrial Revolution by many centuries, but it was not until the early 19th century that modern mass production was possible on a large scale throughout many nations."
    institution_green_revolution: "Green Revolution"
    institution_green_revolution_desc: "Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, new efficient food production methods were introduced into developing countries, which led to a significant rise in the production of food grains (particularly wheat and rice). Significant quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides achieve much higher yields, which raises concerns about its expense and potential impact on the environment. Additionally, as a result, poor farmer' harvests have even lower yields under these new developments because they cannot afford fertilizers and pesticides."
    institution_computing: "Computing"
    institution_computing_desc: "Computing is the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes and the development of both hardware and software—having scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological, and social aspects. The term "computing" is also synonymous with counting and calculating, which was an occupation that fell into the hands of the human-computer prior to the invention of mechanical computing machines."
    institution_internet: "Internet"
    institution_internet_desc: "The Internet, a system design that allows different computer networks all over the world to communicate, has transformed the way the world communicates and its methods of commerce. Every person who connects to one of its constituent networks has access to the Internet's vast and all-encompassing capabilities, which can be used for virtually any purpose. It enables human interaction through electronic mail, chat rooms, newsgroups, and audio/video transmission across long distances. A vast and expanding number of online businesses ("e-businesses") that conduct a majority services via the Internet have found success."
    institution_automation: "Automation"
    institution_automation_desc: "Automation refers to a broad spectrum of technologies that minimize human involvement in processes. When decision criteria, subprocess linkages, and related actions are predetermined and implemented in machines, the need for human intervention is decreased. A massive industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals is one example of an automation application, but it can also refer to smaller applications like a thermostat controlling a boiler. Control complexity can vary greatly, from straightforward on-off control to high-level multivariable algorithms simplified for easy everyday use."
    institution_rationalism: "Rationalism"
    institution_rationalism_desc: "Modern rationalism is inspired by the works of classical Greeks and Islamic thinkers. Its tenants of procedural, evidence-based thought allow both academic and scientific scholars to better evaluate previously accepted facts as well as establish new lines of theory."
    institution_nationalism: "Nationalism"
    institution_nationalism_desc: "The term nationalism is an idea and movement that involves the idea that the nation should be congruent with the state, such as gaining sovereignty over its homeland to make a nation-state free from outside influence, It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on shared social characteristics of culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics, government, religion, traditions and belief in a shared singular history. Nationalism also promotes national unity or solidarity of a nation, and to preserve and foster a nation's culture."
    institution_imperialism: "Imperialism"
    institution_imperialism_desc: "In order to gain control of further territories and lands, we can adopt a state policy of imperialism by extending power and dominion by means of direct territorial acquisition or by gaining political and economic control of the region. This means use of the military, but it is possible to use diplomatic means if necessary. We can begin to colonize empty and unused lands with imperialist policies in order to expand and strengthen our nation."
    institution_marketization: "Mass Marketization"
    institution_marketization_desc: "Evolutions in consumer interest evaluation practices, as well as ongoing restructured private and state enterprise administration, enabled a more effective evaluation and subsequent organization of economies at scale."
    institution_feminism: "Feminism"
    institution_feminism_desc: "Feminism is an interdisciplinary approach to dealing with issues of equality and justice based on sex, gender, gender expression, gender identity, and other characteristics of sexuality as they are perceived via social theories and political action. Historically, feminism has evolved from a critique of gender inequality to a more in-depth analysis of the social and performative constructions of gender and sexuality. The current focus of feminist theory is to investigate injustices and inequality at the points where ability, class, gender, racism, and sex intersect. In cases where these intersections lead to unequal power relations, feminists also seek to correct those circumstances."
    institution_dogmatism: "Dogmatism"
    institution_dogmatism_desc: "Dogmatism is a belief(s) that are accepted by members of a group without being questioned or doubted. It may be in the form of an official system of principles or doctrines of a religion, such as Roman Catholicism, Judaism, or Protestantism. It is generally believed that pious adherents suffer from this rationale, and are unwilling to reason beyond their religion."
    institution_globalization: "Globalization"
    institution_globalization_desc: "Globalization is how trade and technology have increased connectivity and interdependence around the world. The resulting economic and societal developments are also included in the scope of globalization. It can be visualized as the strands of a massive spider web that has grown in size and reached over thousands of years. In the modern era, this web of progress has expanded to reach more people and modernize more countries than ever before."
    institution_environmentalism: "Environmentalism"
    institution_environmentalism_desc: "Environmentalism is the political and ethical movement that aims to change environmentally-damaging human behaviors by adopting political, economic, and social structures that reconsider how humans interact with the natural world and thought to be conducive to the betterment of the environment around society. In a variety of ways, environmentalism contends that while evaluating the morality of political, economic, and social policies, and to consider that entities other than humans and the natural world as a whole should be taken into account."
    institution_social_media: "Social Media"
    institution_social_media_desc: "Social media platforms are interactive technologies that make it easier to form communities through online networks. In the current time, several social media services have been created, all of which share a collective set of features: web-based interactive apps, highly founded on user interaction, such as online discussions, communities, and group chats. This technology allows everyday people to remain connected even from afar."
    institution_space_colonialism: "Space Colonialism"
    institution_space_colonialism_desc: "Space colonization is the permanent habitation of and exploitation of natural resources on celestial bodies other than the planet Earth, going beyond human spaceflight and establishing interstellar outposts. It is the final form of human presence in space. Most people find the most challenging technological and financial hurdles to be involved in just building the necessary infrastructure, yet thanks to intensive research, the impossible is now possible."
