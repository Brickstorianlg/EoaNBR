    institution_industrialization: "Industrialization"
    institution_industrialization_desc: "Industrialization, or the Industrial Revolution was a period from the late eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries in which a transition from hand production methods to machines occurred, as well as increased use of steam and water power, it also boosted the use of textiles, and the textile industry was the first to use modern production methods. The start of the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, as most of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin and design. The Industrial Revolution was also a major turning point in history only compared to the adoption of agriculture."
    institution_mechanization: "Mechanization"
    institution_mechanization_desc: "Mechanization involves mass transition from hand production methods to machines. Once this is completed, the speed at which we can produce things will increase by a lot due to the automatic process that these machines have. We can use things such as steam or water to help further the automatic process. Mechanization started with the Industrial Revolution, just during this time, it is embraced heavily, with a majority of hand production methods now machines. Alongside this, the idea of heavy industrialization will spread amongst nations, in order to keep up with the rest."
    institution_electrification: "Electrification"
    institution_electrification_desc: "We can start to convert a good amount of our power away from fossil fuels and into electricity from things such as the water, steam, and wind. We can also use this in the industrial sector in order to use less fossil fuels, and use more renewable energy sources in order to increase efficiency and decrease pollution. We can use this new electricity in Lighting as well, with newer light bulbs and other things now being a thing."
    institution_mass_transit: "Mass Transit"
    institution_mass_transit_desc: "Now with better methods of transportation, such as better roads, buses, and integrated tram systems. We can now use the idea of mass transit across our nation, using these we can increase the way we transport things around, transport our people, and transport military equipment. This can allow for rapid military deployment when needed, and for our troops to receive better supply, due to new faster methods of travel."
    institution_telecommunications: "Telecommunications"
    institution_telecommunications_desc: "The method of communicating via wire, air and optics, telecommunications allowed the transfer of informations to the horizons at speeds previously unimaginable. The ease of transmission of data, news and the like allowed information to spread much more quicker through a populace, government and command at greater efficacies brought upon many changes in how both people and nations viewed accessibility to what lay beyond home."
    institution_mass_production: "Mass Production"
    institution_mass_production_desc: "Mass production is the production of substantial quantities of standardized products in a constant flow, especially on assembly lines. Mass production techniques predate the Industrial Revolution by many centuries, but it was not until the early 19th century that modern mass production was possible on a large scale throughout many nations."
    institution_green_revolution: "Green Revolution"
    institution_green_revolution_desc: "Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, new efficient food production methods were introduced into developing countries, which led to a significant rise in the production of food grains (particularly wheat and rice). Significant quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides achieve much higher yields, which raises concerns about its expense and potential impact on the environment. Additionally, as a result, poor farmer' harvests have even lower yields under these new developments because they cannot afford fertilizers and pesticides."
    institution_computing: "Computing"
    institution_computing_desc: "Computing is the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes and the development of both hardware and software—having scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological, and social aspects. The term "computing" is also synonymous with counting and calculating, which was an occupation that fell into the hands of the human-computer prior to the invention of mechanical computing machines."
    institution_internet: "Internet"
    institution_internet_desc: "The Internet, a system design that allows different computer networks all over the world to communicate, has transformed the way the world communicates and its methods of commerce. Every person who connects to one of its constituent networks has access to the Internet's vast and all-encompassing capabilities, which can be used for virtually any purpose. It enables human interaction through electronic mail, chat rooms, newsgroups, and audio/video transmission across long distances. A vast and expanding number of online businesses ("e-businesses") that conduct a majority services via the Internet have found success."
    institution_automation: "Automation"
    institution_automation_desc: "Automation refers to a broad spectrum of technologies that minimize human involvement in processes. When decision criteria, subprocess linkages, and related actions are predetermined and implemented in machines, the need for human intervention is decreased. A massive industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals is one example of an automation application, but it can also refer to smaller applications like a thermostat controlling a boiler. Control complexity can vary greatly, from straightforward on-off control to high-level multivariable algorithms simplified for easy everyday use."
    institution_rationalism: "Rationalism"
    institution_rationalism_desc: "Modern rationalism is inspired from the works of classical Greeks and Islamic thinking. Its tenants of procedural, evidence based thought allows both academic and scientific scholars to better evaluate previously accepted facts as well as establish new lines of theory."

It is the final form of human presence in space. Most people find the most challenging technological and financial hurdles to be involved in just building the necessary infrastructure, yet thanks to intensive research, the impossible is now possible."
