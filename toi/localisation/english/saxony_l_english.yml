#General Events
saxony.1.t: "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Domestic Policy"
saxony.1.d: "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] has been heavily involved in the revolutionary uprisings of 1830 and 1848/49. Public pressure mainly exerted by intellectuals and academics in Leipzig and Dresden led to the adoption of a relatively progressive constitution in 1831, which turned the kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, including public elections for the second chamber of the Landtag.\n\nIn the meantime, the [SAX.GetName] was the first country in Germany to experience the rapid changes brought about by the industrial revolution. Primarily around the cities of Chemnitz and Zwickau, a large number of factories were built, mainly specialized in the textile and mechanical engineering industry. With that arose a new social class: the industrial proletariat, which grew increasingly unhappy with the poor labor conditions and a lack of political representation.\n\nFueled by general unhappiness and high unemployment, Saxony was one of the centers of the March Revolution of 1848/49. Violent outbursts forced the king to change the government multiple times, appoint more progressive ministers, end press censorship, and liberalize suffrage laws. As the forces of reaction tried to take back control, bloody street battles ensued after the king had dissolved the Landtag and Prussian troops intervened in Dresden, leaving several hundreds dead. The forces loyal to the crown eventually prevailed, and most of the concessions were revoked.\n\n[SAX.GetNameDef] now finds itself at a crossroads. Whilst aristocrats are clinging on to their privileges, the public demands progress and liberalization, and there's also the question how to handle growing nationalist sentiments among the Sorbs. It will be important to find a balance, develop our economy, and ensure another revolt is prevented, if we want Saxony to thrive and prosper."
saxony.1.a: "Glück auf, Glück auf, mein Sachsenland!"
saxony.2.t: "Ferdinand von Zschinsky Terminally Ill - Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust Appointed Acting Prime Minister"
saxony.2.d: "Prime Minister von Zschinsky had already been in bad health for roughly two years when he embarked on convalescent leave to Southern France and Italy earlier this year, as requested by King Johann. According to the doctors, the prime minister is suffering from a chronic lung condition that can only be cured by a change of climate. The journey did not, however, significantly improve his health, and von Zschinsky returned to Dresden three weeks ago. Earlier today, sad news reached king and parliament: von Zschinsky has fallen dangerously sick and will be unable to carry out his ministerial duties for the foreseeable future. The doctor in charge of von Zschinsky's therapy has made no secret of his doubts whether the prime minister will recover at all...\n\nHis Majesty, King Johann, has already appointed von Zschinsky's longstanding political adversary, foreign minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust, as Acting Prime Minister. Von Beust is known for his liberal-conservative agenda and wants to put Saxony back on the diplomatic map of Europe. Von Zschinsky's deteriorating health might have initiated a significant change in Saxon politics."
saxony.2.a: "Zschinsky's days seem to be numbered..."
saxony.3.t: "Death of Ferdinand von Zschinsky"
saxony.3.d: "After a few days of death throes, Prime Minister Ferdinand von Zschinsky died earlier this morning. His ten years in government as head of the Ministry of the Interior and, finally, prime minister, made von Zschinsky a well-known figure in not only Saxon but also German politics. His juridical prowess also earned him the respect of his colleagues and lawmakers across Europe. A recipient of the Grand Cross of the Saxon Civil Order of Merit, the Imperial Austrian Order of the Iron Crown, and the Imperial Russian Order of Saint Anna, among others, von Zschinsky will be dearly missed and receive an honourable burial."
saxony.3.a: "Ruhe in Frieden."
saxony.4.t: "Death of Ferdinand Lassalle"
saxony.4.d: "Reports are coming in that Ferdinand Lassalle has been confirmed dead. Being a devout socialist and pro-monarchist at the same time, Lassalle was an ideologically conflicting man. He maintained relations with both the arch-communist Karl Marx and the arch-monarchist Otto von Bismarck. Although some will claim that Lassalle was a communist, in the end, he was the same thing that Bismarck was: a nationalist at heart, willing to undertake any social ideology to achieve the goal of a united Germany. His untimely death will surely be a severe blow to moderate socialism in Germany, as the movement loses its most brilliant thinker."
saxony.4.a: "Ruhe in Frieden."

#Foreign Policy
saxonyforeign.1.t: "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Foreign Affairs"
saxonyforeign.1.d: "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] is in a difficult position geographically. Sandwiched between the two German hegemons, the [PRS.GetName] and the [AUS.GetName], and bordering the third German power, the [BAV.GetName] to the south, the government will have to tread carefully, especially on the international stage.\n\nWhilst membership in the Zollverein is of vital economic importance, our relationship to the Zollverein's leading power, Prussia, has not been the greatest. In fact, Saxony had nearly been annexed completely by the [PRS.GetName] during the Vienna Congress of 1815, as a punishment for siding with Napoleon until the last minute.\n\nOnly the intervention of the [AUS.GetName] prevented the complete incorporation of our kingdom into the Prussian state back then, but we still lost over half of our territory and nearly 40% of our population as part of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna. The days when we were considered a European middle power are over, and we only barely managed to prevent the Prussian unification initiative after the March Revolution, known as the Erfurt Union.\n\nWe will have to decide how to proceed from here. We made some promising progress working with the other German minors lately and continuing down this path should be our best option, although it might be hard to get all parties involved on the same page. At the same time we should be careful not to antagonize Austria and Prussia, or our days as an independent country could be numbered..."
saxonyforeign.1.a: "Gott sei mit dir, mein Sachsenland!"
saxonyforeign.2.t: "Prusso-Saxon Relationship - Status Quo"
saxonyforeign.2.d: "Our relations with Prussia have been and are still troublesome, to say the least. Initially allies during the reformationist period and against Austria in the late 18th century, fighting in the Bavarian War of Succession, where Saxony later mediated between the two major powers in Germany. But at the same time Prussia grew ever more in the role of our main enemy, as they became a danger to us, since they strenghthened their military. \n\nEver since the 1740s our relation worsened more and more, but as the French Revolution came and King Louis was deposed (and later executed), Prussia and Saxony agreed to fight on the side of the French King against the republicans. This alliance did exist until 1806, where Napoleon occupied Saxony and we defected to his side. Although we did fight reasonably well and did gain a lot of territory, it all came into unbeing, when Napoleon was defeated in 1815. \n\nAlthough we did lose half of our territory and population to Prussia in 1815, we still managed to keep our independence, as Prussia was hindered to annex us. Our relationship since 1815 was solid. As we are both part of the German Confederation and the Zollverein, we have to work together to bring Germany forward as a whole. In the revolutionary chaos of 1849, Prussia repelled the revolutionaries, since we were not capable to do that ourselves. \n\nSo, we have an ally turned into a enemy, with whom we had a troublesome relationship. How should we fare with Prussia?"
saxonyforeign.2.a: "Prussia is not our ally, and never will be."
SAX_PRS_relation_bad_effect_tt: "§RWe will pursue a path of opposition towards Prussia.§!"
saxonyforeign.2.b: "We need to reconciliate."
SAX_PRS_relation_good_effect_tt: "§GWe will pursue a path of rapprochement towards Prussia.§!"
saxonyforeign.3.t: "Austro-Saxon Relationship - Status Quo"
saxonyforeign.3.d: "Allies since the days of the old Holy Roman Empire, since the Habsburgs took over the title of the Holy Roman Emperor, the Electorate of Saxony and Austria maintained a solid relationship, up until the reformationist period. As our population converted to Lutherism, Austrians preferred to stay Catholic, which naturally caused tensions in the Empire. During the 30 years war, Saxony was first allied to the Austrians, but had to change sides later, as Swedes already occupied a huge chunk of Saxony. \n\nThe peace of Westphalia has brought Saxony some territory and ended the war with Austria. From there onwards, Saxony and Austria maintained a neutral, solid relationship, helping them when Vienna was surronded by the Turks in 1683, and fighting against the Turks in the following war. \n\nHaving had peace for 100 years, Saxony had to intervene in the Bavarian War of Succession, fighting against Austria, before mediating between Prussia and Austria. In the following Napoleonic Wars, Saxony fought on the side on Austria, until it joined Napoleon's 'Rheinbund' in 1806. After that Saxony fought against Austria, until Napoleon lost in 1815. Austria was the reason that we could stay independent after the Congress of Vienna, where Prussia wanted to annex us originally. \n\nWorking together in the German Confederation, Saxony and Austria have formed a friendly relationship and expressed their desire to cooperate, like in the 'Wiener Münzvertrag'. Austria is a important partner when it comes to our foreign policy, since we are assisted by them in military matters, especially against Prussia. \n\nOur relationship with Austria may have had low points before, but we have definetly formed a better relationship now. So, how do we want to approach Austria now, in these trying times?"
saxonyforeign.3.a: "We have a friendly relationship with Austria and will try to intensify it."
SAX_AUS_relation_good_effect_tt: "§RWe will pursue a path of amity towards Austria.§!"
saxonyforeign.3.b: "We need to be as impartial as possible."
SAX_AUS_relation_neutral_effect_tt: "§GWe will pursue a path of neutrality towards Austria.§!"
saxonyforeign.4.t: "[SAX.GetNameDef] Suggests Bundesreform Endeavor"
saxonyforeign.4.d: "The Saxons have announced their intention the reform the German Confederation, to shift some power to the German Bundestag and have presented their idea of opening up a judicative branch in the German Confederation, which shall have authority in the whole of Germany. These ideas could centralise the German Confederation. Should we support Saxony's idea?"
saxonyforeign.4.a: "Give them positive feedback."
SAX_bundesreform_event_positive_effect_tt: "This will encourage the Saxon government in their reform attempt."
saxonyforeign.4.b: "Tell them we are interested, but don't make any promises."
SAX_bundesreform_event_cautious_effect_tt: "This will inform the Saxon government that we need convicing."
saxonyforeign.4.c: "Let them know we are not interested."
SAX_bundesreform_event_negative_effect_tt: "This will notify the Saxon government that our cooperation is doubtful."
saxonyforeign.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Reacts Positively"
saxonyforeign.5.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has responded to our reform agenda."
saxonyforeign.5.a: "Gute Neuigkeiten!"
saxonyforeign.6.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Reacts Cautiously"
saxonyforeign.6.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has responded to our reform agenda."
saxonyforeign.6.a: "Damit lässt sich arbeiten..."
saxonyforeign.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Reacts Negatively"
saxonyforeign.7.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has responded to our reform agenda."
saxonyforeign.7.a: "Wie schade!"
saxonyforeign.8.t: "Saxon Invitation to a Trias Conference"
saxonyforeign.8.d: "[SAX.GetNameDef] has invited us to a gathering of German middle states, the so-called Trias, in Würzburg. The Saxons have been very active diplomatically as of late, trying to build upon the mutual understanding of the smaller German powers at the Bamberg Conference in 1854. They maintain their assertion that the only way to preserve independence and peace for the German minors is to work together much more closely. How will we respond to their invitation?"
saxonyforeign.8.a: "We will join the conference."
saxonyforeign.8.b: "We will not join the conference."
saxonyforeign.9.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts Invitation"
saxonyforeign.9.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted our invitation to the Würzburg Conference, where von Beust, our foreign minister, will present his plan to reform the German Confederation. This proves that [FROM.GetNameDef] wants to assist us in our plan and that they do also oppose the current status quo!"
saxonyforeign.9.a: "Sehr gut!"
saxonyforeign.10.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Rejects Invitation"
saxonyforeign.10.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has rejected our invitation to be a participant of the Würzburg Conference, where von Beust, our foreign minister, will present his plan to reform the German Confederation. This just shows that [FROM.GetNameDef] does not want to take the next step and would rather like Germany to be split under Prussia's and Austria's boots!"
saxonyforeign.10.a: "Schande!"

#Military Events
saxonymilitary.1.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Seeks Military Convention"
saxonymilitary.1.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has requested to sign a military convention with us. This would be a great opportunity for us to gain another ally, who could support our cause and our vision of a strong Germany! We just have to decide whether they would be useful for our cause..."
saxonymilitary.1.a: "That's a wonderful idea, sign the convention."
saxonymilitary.1.b: "[ROOT.GetNameDef] does not need such an agreement."
saxonymilitary.2.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Agrees to Military Convention"
saxonymilitary.2.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to sign a military convention with us! Great news, as we now have found an ally willing to support us in times of crisis and war. Together with [FROM.GetNameDef] our enemies won't have a chance to defeat us!"
saxonymilitary.2.a: "Great news."
saxonymilitary.3.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Rejects Military Convention"
saxonymilitary.3.d: "[FROM.GetNameDef] has refused to sign a military convention with us! They don't think we would be a great help to them and they clearly don't want to assist us, should be drawn into a war in Germany. We should seek alternatives, as our safety is not guaranteed yet!"
saxonymilitary.3.a: "Sad news."

#Sorbian Events
saxonysorbs.1.t: "The Sorbian Question"
saxonysorbs.1.d: "The Sorbs are a West Slavic ethnic group predominantly inhabiting Lusatia, the northwestern part of our realm. As a result of the Vienna Congress of 1815, a large part of the Sorbian lands was seized by the [PRS.GetName], but still there are around 65,000 Sorbs living in the [SAX.GetName]. Sorbian nationalism has been on the rise lately, especially in the context of the March Revolution of 1848/49, and many Sorbian intellectuals hold Panslavic sentiments and maintain ties to other Slavic intellectuals in the east. The latest developments have been increasingly worrying and now we must decide how to proceed with the Sorbian question."
saxonysorbs.1.a: "We need to accept their expression of identity."
saxonysorbs.1.b: "We will continue to basically ignore the matter."
saxonysorbs.1.c: "We need to assimilate them at all costs!"
saxonysorbs.2.t: "Formation of the Sorbian Written Language"
saxonysorbs.2.d: "For centuries, the Sorbs, a West Slavic ethnic minority situated mainly in Lusatia, have mainly communicated and passed down their traditions and history orally. Although there had been written forms of the Sorbian dialects before, they were very inconsistent and mutual intelligibility was not a given. For a few decades now, Sorbian intellectuals have been working hard to establish a fixed grammar, a set of rules that govern the Sorbian language and its dialects. This has strengthened Sorbian nationalism and self-awareness, and we should expect more Sorbian literary, historiographic and linguistic publications in the future."
saxonysorbs.2.a: "Well, good for them."
saxonysorbs.3.t: "Decennial Anniversary of the Maćica Serbska"
saxonysorbs.3.d: "The so-called Maćica Serbska is an influential Sorbian scientific society. Founded in the Lusatian town of Bautzen in 1847, many Sorbian intellectuals like Handrij Zejler (picture) and Jan Arnošt Smoler have found and continue to find inspiration and a common cause in the advancement of the Sorbian culture in the Maćica Serbska. The society has played a key role in the establishment of a Sorbian grammar and literature and will most likely continue to function as a nucleus of Sorbian identity."
saxonysorbs.3.a: "We need to watch them."
saxonysorbs.4.t: "Serbske Nowiny - Sorbian Journal"
saxonysorbs.4.d: "The first Sorbian journal was established in 1842 by Handrij Zejler, who was later joined by Jan Arnošt Smoler. In 1854, the journal was renamed into 'Serbske Nowiny' - Sorbian Newspaper - and circulation has been greatly improved since then. Especially among Protestant Sorbs it exerts significant influence and we have to watch the publishers' activities closely. Our predecessors have already prohibited the paper from printing news regarding foreign affairs, and we will continue to do so for now."
saxonysorbs.4.a: "They need to be controlled."
saxonysorbs.5.t: "New Lusatian Magazine - 40th Anniversary"
saxonysorbs.5.d: "The New Lusatian Magazine, or 'Neues Lausitzisches Magazin', is the publication organ of the Upper Lusatian Society of the Sciences, a scholarly society based in Görlitz. Although the society and its magazine do not specifically agitate Sorbian nationalism and identity, if offers a platform to many Sorbian intellectuals, and their publications resonate with the liberal-progressive bourgeoisie in Saxony and Prussia. Let's hope the scientific advantages outweigh the dangers some of those dissidents pose."
saxonysorbs.5.a: "Not so new anymore, huh?"
saxonysorbs.6.t: "Foundation of the Katolski Posoł - Catholic Sorbian Magazine"
saxonysorbs.6.d: "Recently founded by Michał Hórnik, the Katolski Posoł - Catholic Herald - is a Sorbian magazine aiming specifically at Catholic Sorbs. Whilst religious in character, the magazine could also be used to secretly agitate Sorbian separatist tendencies. We should have an eye on their publications."
saxonysorbs.6.a: "Catholic Sorbians might also be dangerous..."
saxonysorbs.7.t: "Slawisches Zentralblatt - a Weekly Journal with Panslavic Tendencies"
saxonysorbs.7.d: "Jan Arnošt Smoler has recently established another Sorbian Journal, the 'Slawisches Zentralblatt' - Slavic Central Journal, published in German. The subtitle reads 'für Literatur, Kunst, Wissenschaft und nationale Interessen des Gesamtslawentums' - for Literature, Art, Science, and the national interests of all Slavs. Smoler does not bother to cover the Panslavic tendencies of this publication and we will have to make sure to limit and hamper its circulation."
saxonysorbs.7.a: "Sorbian intellectuals reaching out to Russia, alarming..."
saxonysorbs.8.t: "Lusatian-Lower Sorbian Dictionary Published"
saxonysorbs.8.d: "The Sorbian minority is linguistically very different from their German neighbours, which makes mutual intelligibility difficult. The Sorbian language, commonly referred to as 'Wendisch' in Germany, now has a dictionary that makes translations into German and vice versa much easier for people with only little knowledge of both languages. Although using this dictionary would practically enhance the importance and rank of the Wendish language, it does sound like a good opportunity for mutual rapprochement."
saxonysorbs.8.a: "At least we can mutually understand each other now."
saxonysorbs.9.t: "Second Pan-Slav Congress in Vienna"
saxonysorbs.9.d: "A Sorbian delegations has participated in the Second Pan-Slav Congress in Vienna earlier this year. After the first Pan-Slav Congress in Prague in 1847, nationalist and separatist agitation among Slavs reached a boiling point across Eastern Europe, including the [SAX.GetName]. We must be very careful not to let these insurgents cause trouble again. We might have to strengthen our intelligence to deal with them."
saxonysorbs.9.a: "These Panslavic agitators must be stopped."

#Foreign Policy
SAX_decision_category_foreign_policy: "Foreign Affairs of Saxony"
SAX_decision_category_foreign_policy_desc: "The Vienna Congress meant heavy limitations to our possibilities regarding foreign policy. It's time to decide how we want to proceed from here. We can either choose to §Ytighten the bond with the [AUS.GetName]§!, or let bygones be bygones and §Yclosen our relationship with the [PRS.GetName]§!. A third option would be to try and remain neutral, but the success of such an undertaking would require §Ycooperation with the other German minors§!."

SAX_decision_prusso_saxon_rapprochement_desc: "The tide is turning within the German Confederation. Whereas the old hegemon, the [AUS.GetName], is slowly losing ground, power, and influence, her brotherly rival, the [PRS.GetName], has grown to be a truly German power and is modernizing rapidly. We have decided to reapproach the Prussians in order to soften our reliance on Austria."
SAX_decision_convince_the_people: "Convince the People"
SAX_decision_convince_the_people_desc: "The Saxon people are still hurting from the losses we suffered at the hands of the Prussians in 1815. Many families were torn apart and a great number of noblemen lost vast territories in what is now the Prussian province of Saxony, north and east of our border. We need to convince and conciliate these people if our rapprochement is supposed to be successful."

SAX_decision_buy_rifles_from_liege_factories_desc: "If we want to buy quality weaponry, perhaps we should not look to the north or south, but the west. In the shadow of Prussia and Austria, the Belgians are also able to develop good weapons in their Liege factory. We should take a look at them and buy them. It would help us not to make us dependent on one power selling us weapons."
SAX_decision_buy_austrian_rifles: "Buy Rifles from Austria"
SAX_decision_buy_austrian_rifles_desc: "Austria is a great partner for us and at the same time of our fiercest allies. Buying some army equipment from them is a given, especially if one takes into consideration their 'Great Power' status and the fact that we could profit hugely from a trade with them, in terms of money, since we have good relations with each other."
SAX_decision_buy_prussian_cannons: "Buy Cannons from Prussia"
SAX_decision_buy_prussian_cannons_desc: "Although we share a troubled history with our northern neighbour, they managed to improve and reform their army continusly, which elevated them into the status of a Great Power in Europe, whilst our army and state were on the decline since 1815.

SAX_decision_convention_with_prussia_desc: "Our relations may not be the best ones. And our past may be troublesome. But at the same time, Prussia has improved their army since Bismarck became Prussia's Prime Minister and probably exceeds Austria's military capacities already. Although we would definetly lose our claim to our former territory of northern Saxony, allying with Prussia could allow us to stay independent. It may hurt, but signing a military convention with Prussia is the best option we have."
SAX_decision_convention_with_austria: "Ask for Military Convention with Austria"
SAX_decision_convention_with_austria_desc: "The reason why we should pick Austria as our partner are simple. Not only do they want to keep us independent, unlike Prussia did at several occasions, like in 1815, where they wished to outright annex us! But Austria is also a good partner for us for a long time and it is a bigger country than Prussia with a stronger army. Whilst Prussia has reformed their army for quite some time now, Bismarck will not be able to challenge mighty Austria!""

SAX_decision_spiegelglas_friedrichsthal_desc: "The 'Spiegelglashütte Friedrichsthal' was opened in the early 18th century. The reason for it opening was the wish of Saxony to become independent from expensive foreign glass imports. It was in operation for most of the time until 1815, with short breaks inbetween. It was a state-owned company since 1783 until 1815, where we had to cede Friedrichsthal and other parts of the Lausitz to Prussia."

SAX_decision_chemnitzer_actien_spinnerei_desc: "The 'Chemnitzer Actien-Spinnerei' was opened in the beginning of the 18th century, due to the high demand of yarn in the Saxon textile industry. Financed by two banks and some traders, the fabric became the biggest one in Saxony when it opened with around 60.000 spindles and 1.000 workers. It is wearing it's name due to the fact that the company formed for this fabric is a 'Aktiengesellschaft', a public cooperation."

During the industrialisation this industrial sector was equipped with machinery, which in turn raised production levels. Plauen became one of the industrial centers of Saxony.

We would be Prussia's first target in case of war, as our roads are the fastest for reaching Prague and Vienna.

Around the mid of the 18th Century however, it became the home of a orchestra and concerts were played regularly.

From here, he translated the bible into German, which allowed the ordinary people to become independent from the interpretation from the Catholic Church. Some time after that, Christians that believed in Luthers ideas split up from the Catholic Church, and established their protestant one. As the formerly strongest protestant state we did everything to defend our religion, but since then, a long time passed.

SAX_focus_thorough_reforms_desc: "It is clear that we need to reform our Saxony more radical than we would like to do it, since our population already showed us that if we don't react accordingly, they could rise up again. it is the time for through reforms! They are the only way we can stabilise our country after years of conflicts and revolutions."
SAX_focus_universal_male_franchise: "Universal Male Franchise"
SAX_focus_universal_male_franchise_desc: "As part of our reforms, we will have to take a look at our election system. The current system shows that either the King can decide on his deputies in the parliament, or they were just part of it, because of their position. The average Saxon doesn't get to decide on his rulers, and that needs to change immediatly! By introducing a universal male franchise, we would ensure that every male Saxon is able to vote for his parliament, like he could in 1848 and 1849, before the counter-revolutionaries abolished the law again!"
SAX_focus_full_equality_for_sorbs: "Full Equality for the Sorbs"
SAX_focus_full_equality_for_sorbs_desc: "Saxony has a minority that gets oven overlooked - the Sorbs. Sorbs have slavic descendants, in comparison to Saxons that are Germans. Living in eastern Saxony even before the Germans arrived, they were subjugated by the Saxon rulers over the centuries, even if they belong to Saxony like Saxons do. We should abolish these discriminatory laws introduced a long time ago, and instead pass new laws that grant Sorbs full equality in our country, as they should have."
SAX_focus_moderate_reforms: "Moderate Reforms"
SAX_focus_moderate_reforms_desc: "Whilst we should reform Saxony, maybe we should try to find a compromise with the other parties participating in such discussions, as that would ensure us no trouble with any of the others in parliament, or outside of it. This would also make the king more keen to cooperate with us."
SAX_focus_adapt_sufferage_law: "Adapt the Suffrage Law"
SAX_focus_adapt_sufferage_law_desc: "We should seek to change the suffrage law in that regard, that we allow more men, who are over 25 and pay taxes to the state should be allowed to vote for the second chamber of the parliament. We should also try to reform our election system to make the elections equally fair for the entire voting people."
SAX_focus_accept_sorbian_identity: "Accept Sorbian Identity"
SAX_focus_accept_sorbian_identity_desc: "Our relation to the Sorbs was troublesome, whilst the government tried to assimilate them into the Saxon culture. We should stop those antics immediatly and accept that Sorbs do have their own language and culture. This would be a begin in improving our inner Saxon ethnic relations and a way to end the ethnic tensions persisting."
SAX_focus_end_press_censorship: "End Press and Association Censorship"
SAX_focus_end_press_censorship_desc: "Introduced in 1819, our Press censorship should prevent the newspapers and their associations to write articles about any ideas that were contrary to the one of the restauration after the Congress of Vienna. During the 1830 and 1848/49 revolutions, this censorship proved itself very insufficient, and thus, it only hinders people to tell their opinion officially in newspapers, even if they can do it at gatherings. We should seek to abolish this law."
SAX_focus_amnesty_for_insurgents_of_48_49: "Amnesty for Insurgents of 1848/49"
SAX_focus_amnesty_for_insurgents_of_48_49_desc: "Ultimately the insurgents of the May Uprising in Dresden and all the others fought for the right cause - to liberalise Saxony further than it was, even if some of them were a bit to harsh in regard to their ideas or resistance and were captured by the police and troops. We should grant them a general amnesty to show them that the state is not their enemy and as aa sign that we want to truly reform Saxony!"
SAX_focus_civil_law_code: "Civil Law Code"
SAX_focus_civil_law_code_desc: "We need to reform our outdated civil laws, and to do that, we should exchange the old civil laws with a new set of modern civil law and a new civil law code. This would help us in showing that Saxony is truly a modern country with modern law and a modern judicative."
SAX_focus_conserve_the_status_quo: "Conserve the Status Quo"
SAX_focus_conserve_the_status_quo_desc: "Instead of giving in to the liberals, who didn't stop after we granted them reforms in 1830 and 1848, but instead tried to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic, we should seek to maintain stability instead of trying to reform us once again. We should keep the Status Quo, because this system has proven itself to be successful in comparison to short-lived revolutionary states."
SAX_focus_create_elitist_preponderance: "Create Elitist Preponderance"
SAX_focus_create_elitist_preponderance_desc: "Saxony was, is, and probably should be ruled by a monarch and his elite. From the days of the old Saxon electorate until today, Saxony was always a monarchy and always fared will with it. So, why change a running system?"
SAX_focus_revoke_1849_consessions: "Revoke Last Concessions of 1849"
SAX_focus_revoke_1849_consessions_desc: "The concessions we made to the insurgents in 1849 were made so that the protestors could calm down and deaccelarate themselves in their plan to overthrow the monarchy. After the Prussian troops saved our King, it was only a matter of time, when we will revoke the concessions of 1849. Now the time has come, we have a chance now to revoke these concessions and to remove those weaknesses we have brought upon us!"
SAX_focus_the_sorbian_question: "The Sorbian Question"
SAX_focus_the_sorbian_question_desc: "A big question in our political landscape is how to deal with the Sorbs, a Slavic minority group in Eastern Saxony, which demands more and more rights and that we accept their culture. We will have to take a look to see how we can handle this ethnic tension now, since it is not in our interest to escalate it further."
SAX_focus_noble_autocracy: "A Noble Autocracy"
SAX_focus_noble_autocracy_desc: "From the days of the Saxon electorate, Saxony was ruled by a absolute monarch and achieved greatness! It was only the Napoleonic Wars and the subsequent questions of German unification and Saxon liberalism, which weakened Saxony to the level it is today. We should seek to regain this greatness we had and implement necessary changes, with which we can achieve our former glory!"
SAX_focus_revoke_1831_constitution: "Revoke 1831 Constitution"
SAX_focus_revoke_1831_constitution_desc: "The Constitution Saxony gave itself in 1831 established democratic structures into Saxony via the introduction of the parliament, and his two cabinets, and whilst it helped to calm down the citizens back then it also ended the absolute monarchy that was ruling in Saxony until then. A big disaster! But with our rule now consolified, we have the opportunity to reverse this horrible decision that was taken back then and to restore the ruler to his throne and he will be allowed to reign without any interference. Or - in other words - he will rule absolute again!"
SAX_focus_forced_assimilation: "Forced Assimiliation"
SAX_focus_forced_assimilation_desc: "The minority should always adjust to the majority, not the other way around. Perhaps it would be better for the Sorbs to just assimilate to our culture, the 'problem' would disappear immediately then. And if they don't want to do it voluntarily, maybe we need to help them to take the better option for their sake."
SAX_focus_toughen_press_censorship: "Toughen Press and Association Censorship"
SAX_focus_toughen_press_censorship_desc: "In 1819, we decided to implement a law that allowed us to censor the press, so that our goal of restoration after the Congress of Vienna can be achieved without nationalists interfering and wanting to form a German state. As seen in 1830 and 1848, those laws were not harsh enough, so we need to toughen them! If not, our goal may be endangered. Perhaps we could use this danger as a excuse to exclude newspapers that are overly democratic or liberal, so that our monarchist position will be strenghthened too!"
SAX_focus_renew_warrents_for_insurgents_of_48_49: "Renew Warrants for Insurgents of 1848/49"
SAX_focus_renew_warrents_for_insurgents_of_48_49_desc: "The insurgents of 1848 and 1849 seeked to overthrow our monarchy and establish a liberal democracy, which would have ruined Saxony! Those traitors do not deserve freedom. We should prolong their warrants and teach them a lesson! Such a step would contribute to the stability and safety of our society!"
SAX_focus_supress_workers_movement: "Suppress Workers Movement"
SAX_focus_supress_workers_movement_desc: "Following the industrialisation and especially during the last years, a new movement has risen. The workers have formed a movement, which seeks to radically alter our society. Some members of their movement also seek to overthrow the monarchy and establish a more extreme republic than even the liberals want! We need to surpress this movement for the good of our society!"

#Army
SAX_focus_saxonys_army: "Saxony's Army"
SAX_focus_saxonys_army_desc: "After our defeat in the Napoleonic Wars and us being the last ally of Napoleon that defected from him, we were punished severely by the Great Powers at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Whilst we have lost a big part of our army, the last years have shown us that we need to be able to react to revolutions and wars in Germany, in which we are directly involved. We need to start to rearm our soldiers!"
SAX_focus_reinforce_conscription_laws: "Reinforce Conscription Laws"
SAX_focus_reinforce_conscription_laws_desc: "A first step in rearming of our army would be to reinforce our conscription law and, thus, conscript more men for the defense of our country. They could be needed if the situation in the German Confederation escalates..."
SAX_focus_reform_officers_training: "Reform Officers' Training"
SAX_focus_reform_officers_training_desc: "Whilst conscripting more soldiers will certainly help to strenghten our army and increase our manpower, it won't be useful if we put them under the control of officiers that use old, outdated doctrines or use outlawed punishments to 'teach' the soldier a lection. We need to reform and modernise our officiers' training, so that we can be able to build a successful military again!"
SAX_focus_obtain_foreign_military_equipment: "Obtain Foreign Military Equipment"
SAX_focus_obtain_foreign_military_equipment_desc: "Whilst we are able to change some things in our army, like conscripting more men or put up some reforms, we do not produce quality weapons, with which we could equip our men. Because of that, we will need to take a look at foreign weapons and think about buying them, as we want our soldiers to have the best possible equipment."
SAX_focus_buy_rifles_from_liege_factories: "Buy Rifles from Liège Factories"
SAX_focus_buy_rifles_from_liege_factories_desc: "If we want to buy quality weaponry, perhaps we should not look to the north or south, but the west. In the shadow of Prussia and Austria, the Belgians are also able to develop good weapons in their Liege factory. We should take a look at them and buy them. It would help us not to make us dependent on one power selling us weapons."
SAX_focus_buy_austrian_rifles: "Buy Austrian Rifles"
SAX_focus_buy_austrian_rifles_desc: "Austria is a great partner for us and at the same time of our fiercest allies. Buying some army equipment from them is a given, especially if one takes into consideration their 'Great Power' status and the fact that we could profit hugely from a trade with them, in terms of money, since we have good relations with each other."
SAX_focus_buy_prussian_cannons: "Buy Prussian Cannons"
SAX_focus_buy_prussian_cannons_desc: "Although we share a troubled history with our northern neighbour, they managed to improve and reform their army continusly, which elevated them into the status of a Great Power in Europe, whilst our army and state were on the decline since 1815. We would definetly profit in terms of the quality of the cannons if we would decide to import them, even if it is from one of our greatest feuds."
SAX_focus_sign_military_convention: "Sign a Military Convention..."
SAX_focus_sign_military_convention_desc: "The situation in the German Confederation is worsening. After their successful war against Denmark, the Austro-Prussian coalition fell apart and now their situation in Schleswig and Holstein may eventually lead to a direct confrontation between the two great powers in Germany. As we are not able to survive by ourselves in this regard, we will have to choose our side..."
SAX_focus_convention_with_prussia: "...with Prussia"
SAX_focus_convention_with_prussia_desc: "Our relations may not be the best ones. And our past may be troublesome. But at the same time, Prussia has improved their army since Bismarck became Prussia's Prime Minister and probably exceeds Austria's military capacities already. Allying with Prussia would also be good from our strategic point of view, as Austrian reinforcements would only arrive after we would have lost a majority of our territory against Prussia. Although we would definetly lose our claim to our former territory of northern Saxony, allying with Prussia could allow us to stay independent, whilst allying with Austria could mean the end of Saxony as a independent state. It may hurt, but signing a military convention with Prussia is the best option we have."
SAX_focus_convention_with_the_trias: "...with the Trias"
SAX_focus_convention_with_the_trias_desc: "In accordance to our policies during the last years we should sign a military convention with the Trias, the other German states, that do not want to pick a side. With signing this convention we have a huge chance that neither of the great powers could invade us, even if we have a direct route to Berlin or Prague, as neither Prussia nor Austria wants to have a united Trias no fight side on side with their enemy in case of war. We could secure our safety and security with that move, even if the Trias is not stronger than Prussia or Austria alone."
SAX_focus_convention_with_austria: "...with Austria"
SAX_focus_convention_with_austria_desc: "The reason why we should pick Austria as our partner are simple. Not only do they want to keep us independent, unlike Prussia did at several occasions, like in 1815, where they wished to outright annex us! But Austria is also a good partner for us for a long time and it is a bigger country than Prussia with a stronger army. Whilst Prussia has reformed their army for quite some time now, Bismarck will not be able to challenge mighty Austria!"
SAX_focus_army_administration_reform: "Army Administration Reform"
SAX_focus_army_administration_reform_desc: "In the same way that we are reforming our officers' training, we should also take into consideration to reform the army administration, seeing how it went untouched after our defeat 1815 and after the revolution of 1848, in which our army and the administration showed several deficits."
SAX_focus_new_court_martial_jurisdiction: "New Court Martial Jurisdiction"
SAX_focus_new_court_martial_jurisdiction_desc: "Our army jurisdiction is outdated. Since we are reforming our army currently, we could take a look at the outdated structures in the military jurisdiction and reform them as well. If we want to have a strong and modern army, we also need to have a strong, independent jurisdiction!"
SAX_focus_new_military_trial_codes: "New Military Trial Codes of Procedure"
SAX_focus_new_military_trial_codes_desc: "Since we already are in the process of reforming our army, perhaps we should also take a look at our outdated army trial codes and rework those as well."
SAX_focus_new_military_leadership: "New Military Leadership"
SAX_focus_new_military_leadership_desc: "With our army reforming and taking several steps forward, perhaps we should choose a new leader for our military. He will get the responsibility of organising and mobilising our troops, if necessary, to defend ourselves from possible attacks."
SAX_focus_field_marshall_kronpinz_albert: "Field Marshall Kronprinz Albert"
SAX_focus_field_marshall_kronpinz_albert_desc: "Albert, the oldest son of our King Johann, is the designated successor of his father. As Kronprinz, he will need to learn to take responsibility of Saxon matters and he will need to learn how to handle such responsibility. Perhaps it would be suitable to name him Field Marshall, so that he will have a chance to learn how to handle army matters."
SAX_focus_field_marshall_prinz_georg: "Field Marshall Prinz Georg"
SAX_focus_field_marshall_prinz_georg_desc: "With our Kronprinz being heavily invested in political matters and taking a active role in the state council, we should not involve him into our army and give him additional burdens. Instead, we could name his younger brother, Georg, Field Marshall, since he does not partake in politics or other state matters."

#Economy
SAX_focus_saxonys_economy: "Saxony's Economy"
SAX_focus_saxonys_economy_desc: "Like any other German state, Saxony began industrialising at the beginning of the 19th century. But, unlike the others, we managed to become one of the dominant industrial powers in Germany, dominating in the Zollverein, and managed to build the densest railway network in the German Confederation. And if we wish to stay in this position, we have to take further steps, to industrialise further and keep expanding our infrastructure."
SAX_focus_saxon_state_railway: "Expand Railway Infrastructure"
SAX_focus_saxon_state_railway_desc: "One step to keep up our dominance in the industrial sector is to build even more railways inside of Saxony, to persuade others into investing even more in us and to fasten the transport of much needed material into the fabrics. Investing into the railway system thus means more money and power for Saxony!"
SAX_customeffect_infra_bonus_one: "§Y1x§! §G50%§! Construction speed bonus for: §YInfrastructure§!"
SAX_focus_railway_bavaria: "Railway Connection\nto Bavaria"
SAX_focus_railway_bavaria_desc: "In 1841, we opened a railway line that connected us with Bavaria, but through Altenburg, which is part of Thuringia. To circumvent a issue by Thuringia cutting off the railway line, we have decided in 1845 to build another line between Chemnitz, an important industrial center of Saxony, and Bavaria. Whilst we already have opened the part starting from Zwickau to Bavaria, we have not been able to complete the Chemnitz-Zwickau railway, until now. We shall open the railway line and enable the fabrics in Chemnitz to import the resources needed from Bavaria and export the finished products."
SAX_focus_railway_ore_mountains: "Railways in the\nOre Mountains"
SAX_focus_railway_ore_mountains_desc: "Now that we have finished most of our railway system in Saxony and have established a railway connection towards Bavaria, we need to think about the next possible connection we need to build. One of these connections would be between Chemnitz and the Ore Mountains, which also is the border between Saxony and our southern partner Austria. Building this railway line could help us in two regards, first it allows us, or the industry in Saxony, to import lignite from the North Bohemian Basin in northwestern Bohemia. The second reason for building a railway is, that our partners from Austria could defend us in a, albeit unlikely, war against Prussia."
SAX_focus_railway_prussia: "Railway Connection\nto Prussia"
SAX_focus_railway_prussia_desc: "We have finished our connection with our southern neighbours now. Now, we should begin thinking about building a railway connection towards our northern neighbour, Prussia. Building such a railway would connect us with the Ruhrgebiet and Silesia, two regions in Germany, where a lot of resources are obtained. We could also try to improve our relations with them by working together on a project."
SAX_focus_railway_gaps: "Close the Gaps in\nthe Network"
SAX_focus_railway_gaps_desc: "Now that we have built a dense railway system in Saxony, connected our railways to our neighbours ones, our only priority left is to close the gaps between the railways and to complete our railway system for now."
SAX_focus_mining_and_metallurgy: "Mining & Metallurgy"
SAX_focus_mining_and_metallurgy_desc: "Whilst we have industrialised since the begin of this century, we still need to extract natural resources that we can use to process further in our fabrics. We have to do so in our state-owned mines and metallurgies."
SAX_focus_queen_mary_ironworks: "Königin Marienhütte"
SAX_focus_queen_mary_ironworks_desc: "Opened in 1839 in Zwickau, the 'Königin Marienhütte' is one of the biggest companies in Saxony. It is located near Zwickau, because the main resource, coal, used by them, is being extracted in the local coal mine. The products produced in the 'Marienhütte', namely railway tracks and bridges made out of steel, are used by us to build up our railway system and expand our infrastructure in general. A true piece of Saxon class!"
SAX_customeffect_coal_mine_bonus_one: "§Y1x§! §G75%§! Construction speed bonus for: §YCoal Mine§!"
SAX_focus_soften_bergregal: "Soften the Bergregal"
SAX_focus_soften_bergregal_desc: "The Bergregal is a act, that declares the nobility of a country the owner of the several mineral resourches in the country. Introduced during the days of the early Holy Roman Empire, it is still a law in Saxony, which may cause problems in our industrial development, since possible investors could be discouraged to invest. To prevent this, we shall go ahead and soften the Bergregal, to open up more investment opportunities for foreign investors, even if it means that the ing has to give up his (non-existant) claims over Saxony's natural resources!"
SAX_focus_expand_mining_districts: "Expand Mining Districts"
SAX_focus_expand_mining_districts_desc: "Since we have softened the Bergregal, we can decide now where exactly mines should be established. Some politicians do think that it is the best idea to expand existing mining destricts and opening up new mines will help our economy and attract new investors."
SAX_focus_enact_berggesetz: "Enact Berggesetz"
SAX_focus_enact_berggesetz_desc: "Although we have now de facto abolished the 'Bergregal' by the nobility giving up their claims and already opening up the mining sector to investors, it is still in act in our law. We need to abolish it officially and replace it by a more liberal law, that does officially allow investors to invest in those sectors affected by the 'Bergregal'. Perhaps we can also make the metallurgies independent with this law."
SAX_focus_factory_industry: "Factory Industry"
SAX_focus_factory_industry_desc: "In 1854, the lawyer Karl Heine began to buy land in the municipality of Plagwitz, and began to develop the necessary infrastructure to be able to attract rich investors, in which he had some reasonable success. We should support Heine in his task, since we would also profit a lot from new investments and a stronger industry!"
SAX_focus_proto_industrialization: "Legacy of Proto-Industrialization"
SAX_focus_proto_industrialization_desc: "Before the process of industrialisation arrived in Saxony, there were already some workers who did in early factories, like the workers in the textile industry did. Although they were working in fabrics back then, they still had to do everything by hand and did not have machines that supported them. We should remember those and try to further develop our machines to not have to return to those days again."
SAX_focus_free_enterprise: "The Need for Free Enterprise"
SAX_focus_free_enterprise_desc: "We will need to adjust our laws in order to attract investors, as we have too harsh laws currently, which hamper the development of our economy."
SAX_focus_textile_industry: "Saxon Textile Industry"
SAX_focus_textile_industry_desc: "Saxony has had a long history with the textile industry. Ever since the industrialisation began and Saxony became one of the most developed countries in Central Europe, multiple companies have opened fabrics in Saxony. But that is not the end - we have several other businessmen that are eager to open new fabrics in Saxony. We should support them, as we would profit of a stronger textile industry."
SAX_focus_saxon_manchester: "Chemnitz -\nThe Saxon Manchester"
SAX_focus_saxon_manchester_desc: "The heart of the industrialised Saxony lies in Chemnitz. Here, most of the companies and investors decide to open fabrics and produce textiles and the city has a great connection with the other Saxon and German regions. Like Manchester in England, Chemnitz is the industrial centre of our Saxony! But if we want to progressing we will need to expand our industrial branches, to not get dependent on our textile industry. We shall support the growth of the mechanical engineering industry."
SAX_focus_trade_and_commerce: "Trade & Commerce"
SAX_focus_trade_and_commerce_desc: "Saxony is not only a country that has a strong industry, in fact it is also a strong power in trading and in commerce. Due to our trade, from the 16th century onwards, we have managed to become a important economic partner and one of the economical centers in Europe. We should try to keep up that status, as our economy benefits massively from it!"
SAX_focus_allgemeine_creditanstalt: "Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt"
SAX_focus_allgemeine_creditanstalt_desc: "The 'Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt' was established in 1856 and is a Saxon bank. They are a symbol of Saxony's strength in the trade and finance sector and are a good partner, when it comes to investing. During their first year they have already managed to establish themselves in the German market and have announced their ambitious plans. They will surely be useful is we need a credit someday..."
SAX_focus_leipzig_book_fair: "Leipzig Book Fair"
SAX_focus_leipzig_book_fair_desc: "The Leipzig Book Fair has a long tradition in our country. First organised in the 17th century, it did grow from year to year, and is now the biggest book fair in the entirety of Germany, even bigger than the Frankfurt Book Fair, it's traditional rival organisation. Every year the world is being shown the Saxon and German culture, and we could use the fair to promote our own culture in Saxony and in other countries."
SAX_focus_pelzhandelszentrum_leipzig: "Pelzhandelszentrum Leipziger Brühl"
SAX_focus_pelzhandelszentrum_leipzig_desc: "Our 'Pelzhandelszentrum' in Leipzig is a big part of Leipzig, and in turn, Saxony's economy. Being the biggest fur sale center, it became synonomous with fur sales itself. Its strength contributes to Saxony's economy and so it has to be obtained - by all means."
SAX_focus_saxon_bank_dresden: "Sächsische Bank zu Dresden"
SAX_focus_saxon_bank_dresden_desc: "A way to strenghten our economy and other parts of society is to open a bank, which is able to give various credits to companies and investors. Luckily for us, some businessman have expressed a interest in opening up such a bank. If we assist them with monetary concessions, we will be able to strengthen in fact our own economy and will have a bank that is connected to us."
SAX_focus_model_country: "Industrializing\nModel Country"
SAX_focus_model_country_desc: "Our already excellent position in the German industry and status as great industrial power was already secured. But still, reforms were necessary to keep that status. Our successful reforms have modernised Saxony and expanded it's industrial might - both in Germany and abroad. We are heading into a bright future with our unstoppable economy!"

SAX_idea_anti_prussian_sentiments: "Anti Prussian Sentiments"
SAX_idea_anti_prussian_sentiments_desc: "Just over 40 years ago, Prussia stripped away 60% of Saxon territory as a result of the Congress of Vienna. Prussia was barely stopped from annexing the entire nation, it is clear they have little regard for the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Saxony. The Napoleonic Wars brought Prussia back to the table of the European great powers, and their ambition to unite all German states is most threatening to Saxon independence."
SAX_idea_land_owners_prevalence_1: "Land Owners Prevalence"
SAX_idea_land_owners_prevalence_1_desc: "Our current suffrage legislation favors land owners and aristocrats. The dominance of these old elites hampers our ability to develop our industry and makes it harder to open our country for foreign ideas, businesses and capital."
SAX_idea_land_owners_prevalence_2: "Land Owners Prevalence"
SAX_idea_land_owners_prevalence_2_desc: "Our current legislation heavily favors land owners and aristocrats. The dominance of these old elites hampers our ability to develop our industry and makes it harder to open our country for foreign ideas, businesses and capital."
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1: "Sorbian Tensions"
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1_desc: "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. For centuries, Saxons have forcibly assimilated Sorbs through a destruction of Sorbian culture, literature, and language. Recently, the Sorbs have become more boisterous, thousands of them call for an end to the assimilation, and the tensions now risk boiling over."
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_2: "Sorbian Minority"
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_2_desc: "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. The Sorbian national culture is currently enjoying its heyday in poetry, music, literature, and language. Nevertheless, the way of mutual recognition will probably ease tensions and assist in their peaceful assimilation in the long run."
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_3: "Forced Sorbian Assimilation"

Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. The Sorbian national culture is currently enjoying its heyday in poetry, music, literature, and language. We must crash their separatist tendencies and force them to assimilate!"

#Country Leader Descriptions
SAX_FERDINAND_VON_ZSCHINSKY_LEADER_DESC: "Having studied and worked as a lawyer in the private, public, and aristocratic spheres, Ferdinand von Zschinsky served a two-week stint as the head of Saxony's Ministry of the Interior in 1848 before being appointed leader of the Saxon government by King Friedrich August II in 1849, an honour that eventually earned him an aristocratic title in 1856.\n\nZschinsky's leadership has been ideologically mixed: one of his government's first actions was the dissolution of the Saxon State Parliament and the reinstatement of the less liberal 1831 constitution (a major reversal of concessions made in the wake of the 1848 revolutions), but on the other hand he has also stripped feudal landlords of their legal jurisdiction and separated the powers of the state and judiciary.\n\nWhile his time in office has been consequential for Saxony, Ferdinand von Zschinsky is in ailing health, and he likely does not have much more time to lead."
